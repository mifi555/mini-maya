After attending office hours all of this week and posting on Ed, I wasn't able to correctly implement the Catmull Clark Subdivision. I tried to complete as much of the assignment as I could with the late day that I had. I believe that my code has all the right steps; however, I am just not able to produce the right output when I subdivide the mesh. I was encouraged by a TA to reach out to Adam and ask for debugging help.
